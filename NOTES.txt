PLAN:
* start by making the API
    * express
* make the router in a file
    * add the middleware - bodyparser
* make the calls
* add the database aspect




THOUGHTS:

* make a router file called inventory
* make routes such as
    * get all
    * add one
    * remove one

* experiment with adding many tables
* one database, many tables

* add a simple front end
    * list inventory in a box
    * get list of all item types, then click one to update it
